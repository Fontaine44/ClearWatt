      <p>Hydrogen is set to play a pivotal role in the global energy transition, with the potential to abate 80 gigatons of CO₂ emissions by 2050. As an energy storage medium and decarbonization tool for industries like steel, aviation, and heavy transport, hydrogen bridges renewable energy with hard-to-abate sectors. Achieving these ambitions will require over $300 billion in investments by 2030.</p>
